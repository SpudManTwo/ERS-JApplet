# ERS-JApplet

This is a small little project I made back in high school. It plays through an entire game of "Egyptian Ratscrew". It uses TimerTasks to set difficulty and enables you to play against up to 3 AI players. There is an additional helper mode that will highlight the deck when you should slap it. All the images of the cards are already included. To run it just run the Menu class as a Java Applet or open the Page.html if you allow the Java Applet to run there. I personally recommend the former because it is less buggy but I included the latter in case anyone wants to get the feeling of what it would look like in a webpage format. Everything should be self explanatory from there.

Rules of What to Slap/Click On:
Sandwiches (6,7,6 Or 8,K,8)
Doubles (7,7 Or J,J)
Fives

Number of Chances for Face Cards:
Ace-4
King-3
Queen-2
Jack-1
